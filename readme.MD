# Decihering the crowd: Modeling and Identification of Pedestrian Group Motion

This repository contains the resources necessary for reproducing the results reported in our manuscript [1]. The implementation is done in Matlab7 with no specific dependencies.

Specifically, the repository is organized as collection data setm, main routine(s), and auxiliaries. The raw data set analyzed during the study is publicly available at [2]

, since it contains privacy information and relates to the performance of the software company. Nevertheless, it is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. In addition, we provide information on the contents of the organization of the data set, since it helps in understanding our software.

Please see below for brief explanation of each software component. For a high-level overview of each script, please see the docstrings appearing on the top of each file and for low-level descriptions please look into the functions.
